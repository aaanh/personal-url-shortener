# Personal Simple URL Shortener

## What does it do?

This is a URL shortener. It takes a long URL and converts it into a
short URL. It is useful for sharing long URLs on social media or any
URLs for that matter.

Although, currently the shortening is done manually by adding K, V
pairs in the link database.

## What is it built on?

It is built using the Nextjs framework on top of React. The project
was generated using [create-t3-app template](https://github.com/t3-oss/create-t3-app).

The path name generation utilizes dynamic routing feature of Nextjs{" "}
`[pathname].js`.
